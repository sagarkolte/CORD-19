      <td>This study shows that the disease free equilibrium ( ) for COVID-19 coronavirus does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability. This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. Also, the Basic Reproductive number ( 0 &lt; 1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originating from Wuhan, China in early December, has infected more than 70,000 people in China and other countries and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach. Government action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number R 0 -the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of R 0 vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of R 0 across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation intervalḠ, and the generation-interval dispersion κ. We then apply our framework to early estimates of R 0 for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early R 0 estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of R 0 , including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate R 0 at the outset of an epidemic.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>The outbreak of novel coronavirus has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread -with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform agedependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>MERS-coronavirus infection is currently responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in Saudi Arabia. Understanding its burden, as an emerging infectious disease, is vital for devising appropriate control strategies. In this study, the burden of MERS-CoV was estimated over 31 months period from June 6, 2012 to January 5, 2015. The total number of patients was 835; 528 (63.2%) patients were male, 771 (92.3%) patients were ≥25 years of age, and 210 (25.1%) patients were healthcare workers. A total of 751 (89.9%) patients required hospitalization. The median duration between onset of illness and hospitalization was 2 days (interquartile range, 0-5). The median length of hospital stay was 14 days (IQR, 6-27). The overall case fatality rate was 43.1%. Basic reproductive number was 0.9. Being Saudi, non-healthcare workers, and age ≥65 years were significantly associated with higher mortality. In conclusion, MERS-CoV infection caused a substantial health burden in Saudi Arabia.</td>
