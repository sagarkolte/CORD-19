      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>As of March 8, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had caused 80,815 human infections and 3073 deaths in China, including more than 3000 infections among medical staff. Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital (Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China), a provincial emergency hospital, has treated more than 35 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 260 suspected cases. Most of nurses' work involves direct contact with patients. As nurses have high vulnerability to COVID-19, it is necessary to establish hospital-specific protocols to reduce the risk of nurses' infection in interactions with COVID-19 patients. Our hospital has maintained a "zero nurse infection" rate while battling SARS in 2003 and during the present COVID-19 epidemic. The following are the key measures implemented in our hospital.</td>

      <td>The novel coronavirus disease-2019 has been spreading around the world rapidly and declared as a pandemic by WHO. Here, we compared the ABO blood group distribution in 2,173 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 test from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China with that in normal people from the corresponding regions. The results showed that blood group A was associated with a higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups. This is the first observation of an association between the ABO blood type and COVID-19. It should be emphasized, however, that this is an early study with limitations. It would be premature to use this study to guide clinical practice at this time, but it should encourage further investigation of the relationship between the ABO blood group and the COVID-19 susceptibility.</td>

      <td>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been pandemic all over the world. This study described acute kidney injury (AKI) at early stage of COVID-19 and its clinical significance. Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-+19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P&lt;0.001). In conclusion, male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes are more susceptible to AKI. AKI at early stage may be a negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>The new coronavirus COVID-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 300,000 patients and become a global health emergency due to the very high risk of spread and impact of COVID-19. There are no specific drugs or vaccines against COVID-19, thus effective antiviral agents are still urgently needed to combat this virus. Herein, the FEP (free energy perturbation)-based screening strategy is newly derived as a rapid protocol to accurately reposition potential agents against COVID-19 by targeting viral proteinase Mpro. Restrain energy distribution (RED) function was derived to optimize the alchemical pathway of FEP, which greatly accelerated the calculations and first made FEP possible in the virtual screening of the FDA-approved drugs database. As a result, fifteen out of twenty-five drugs validated in vitro exhibited considerable inhibitory potencies towards Mpro. Among them, the most potent Mpro inhibitor dipyridamole potentially inhibited NF-B signaling pathway and inflammatory responses, and has just finished the first round clinical trials. Our result demonstrated that the FEP-based screening showed remarkable advantages in prompting drug repositioning against COVID-19.</td>

      <td>Background ： ： ： ： Cancer patients are regarded as a highly vulnerable group in the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown. Patients and methods： ： ： ：In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0). Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%). 8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%). The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (13, 46.3%). 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and mortality was 28.6%. If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037). Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk for developing severe events (HR=5.438, 95%CI</td>
