      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>Strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China. As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can help guide global intervention policies.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries worldwide. Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the community. Here, we report the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. The 10-year-old girl was a close contact of her uncle and mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19. In this report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens. Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal strategy of self-quarantine and patient care in a negative isolation room for children.</td>

The bacterial pathogens most frequently found are enteropathogenic clones of E. coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella enterica subsp., Campylobacter spp. and Aeromonas spp. The most frequently identified causative viruses (outside local epidemics) include rotavirus, caliciviruses (norovirus and sapovirus), astrovirus and enteric adenovirus. Less prevalent viruses include paramyxovirus, morbillivirus, rubivirus and reovirus. The prevalence of norovirus has been recently estimated to be 12% in children under 5 years of age hospitalized for severe diarrhea and 12% of mild and moderate diarrhea cases among patients of all ages. 12 These authors estimated that noroviruses were responsible for up to 200 000 deaths of children &lt;5 years of age in LMIC. 12 SURVEILLANCE Not all enteric pathogens are notifiable, depending on the country. Moreover, a recent study in six US states indicated that multiple steps between onset of food-borne illness and its investigation by a public health agency could take up to 3 weeks. 6</td>

Asthma, rhinitis, other respiratory diseases Background: Although known as common causes of upper respiratory infections, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses are poorly studied as inducers of wheezing in infants, and their possible role in the development of childhood asthma has not been investigated. Objective: The purposes of this study were to assess the occurrence of RV, enterovirus, and coronavirus infections in wheezing infants and to evaluate the association of these viral findings with early school-age asthma. Methods: In 1999, outcome in relation to asthma was studied in 82 of 100 initially recruited children who had been hospitalized for wheezing in infancy during the period 1992-1993. In 2000, etiologic viral studies regarding the index episode of wheezing were supplemented by rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus detection by RT-PCR from frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates in 81 of the children for whom adequate samples were available. Of these children, 66 had participated in the follow-up in 1999. Results: Rhinoviruses were identified in 27 (33%) of the 81 children, enteroviruses in 10 (12%), and coronaviruses in none. Rhinoviruses were present as single viral findings in 22 (81%) of the 27 rhinovirus-positive cases, and rhinovirus infections were associated with the presence of atopic dermatitis in infancy. Enteroviruses were commonly encountered in mixed infections and had no association with atopy. As single viral findings, rhinoviruses were associated with the development of asthma (P = .047; odds ratio, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.02-16.77 versus rhinovirus-negative cases [by logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and atopic dermatitis on entry)]. Conclusion: Our results present rhinoviruses as important inducers of wheezing even in infancy. The association with atopy and subsequent asthma calls for reevaluation of the role of rhinoviruses in the development of asthma. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003;111:66-71.)</td>

      <td>Background: The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia is globally concerning. We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported. Methods: Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared. Findings: Compared with the non-pregnant adults group ( n = 14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed ( n = 16) and clinically-diagnosed ( n = 25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults ( P = 0 ·007, P &lt; 0 ·001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults ( P = 0 ·001, P &lt; 0 ·001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twentythree patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6-9 days after initial CT scans. Interpretation: Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation. The exposure history and clinical symptoms were more helpful for screening in children versus chest CT.</td>

Background: Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common complication of a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) in children. The virus-induced host inflammatory response in the nasopharynx plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AOM. Suppression of this inflammatory process might prevent the development of AOM as a complication. Objective: We sought to assess the effect of intranasally administered fluticasone propionate on prevention of AOM during a viral respiratory infection. Methods: A total of 210 children (mean age, 2.1 years; range, 0.7-3.9 years) with normal middle ear status and URI of 48 hours' duration or less were randomly allocated to receive either fluticasone (100 µg twice daily) or placebo for 7 days. The specific viral cause of the infection was determined from nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained at the first visit. The children were re-examined at the end of the 7-day medication period. Results: In the fluticasone group AOM developed in 40 (38.1%) of 105 children compared with 29 (28.2%) of 103 children receiving placebo (P = .13). The viral cause of the respiratory infection was determined in 167 (86.1%) of 194 children from whom a nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained. In children with rhinovirus infection, AOM developed significantly more often in the fluticasone group (45.7%) than in the placebo group (14.7%, P = .005). Conclusion: Intranasally administered fluticasone does not prevent the development of AOM during URI but may increase the incidence of AOM during rhinovirus infection.

      <td>This study aims to analyze the different clinical characteristics between children and their families infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Clinical data from nine children and their 14 families were collected, including general status, clinical, laboratory test, and imaging characteristics. All the children were detected positive result after their families onset. Three children had fever (22.2%) or cough (11.2%) symptoms and six (66.7%) children had no symptom. Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough (35.7%), chest tightness/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%). Nearly 70% of the patients had normal (71.4%) or decreased (28.6%) white blood cell counts, and 50% (7/14) had lymphocytopenia. There were 10 adults (71.4%) showed abnormal imaging. The main manifestations were pulmonary consolidation (70%), nodular shadow (50%), and ground glass opacity (50%). Five discharged children were admitted again because their stool showed positive result in SARS-CoV-2 PCR. COVID-19 in children is mainly caused by family transmission, and their symptoms are mild and prognosis is better than adult. However, their PCR result in stool showed longer time than their families. Because of the mild or asymptomatic clinical process, it is difficult to recognize early for pediatrician and public health staff.</td>

      <td>School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national-and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find significant associations between levels of absenteeism and COVID-19 complication factors. We observe from our models that an estimated 98.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures, identifying child care subsidization as a potential solution to help maintain healthcare systems during a pandemic.</td>
