      <td>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease. After the appearance of an index patient in Hong Kong in February 2003, SARS outbreaks occurred rapidly in hospitals and spread to the community. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a triage policy and risk-stratified infection control measures in preventing nosocomial SARS infection among paediatric healthcare workers (HCWs) at the Prince of Wales Hospital, a general hospital to which children with SARS are referred in Hong Kong. The acute paediatric wards were stratified into three areas: (1) ultra high-risk area, (2) high-risk area and (3) moderate-risk area according to different risk levels of nosocomial SARS transmission. The implementation of different levels of infection control precautions was guided by this risk stratification strategy. Between 13 March and 23 June, 38 patients with probable and suspected SARS, 90 patients with non-SARS pneumonia, and 510 patients without pneumonia were admitted into our unit. All probable SARS cases were isolated in negative-pressure rooms. Twenty-six HCWs worked in the ultra high-risk area caring for SARS patients and 88 HCWs managed non-SARS patients in other ward areas. None of the HCWs developed clinical features suggestive of SARS. In addition, there was no nosocomial spread of SARS-associated coronavirus to other patients or visitors during this period. In conclusion, stringent infection control precautions, appropriate triage and prompt isolation of potential SARS patients may have contributed to a lack of nosocomial spread and HCW acquisition of SARS in our unit.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>Viruses are the most frequent cause of respiratory disease in children. However, despite the advanced diagnostic methods currently in use, in 20 to 50% of respiratory samples a specific pathogen cannot be detected. In this work, we used a metagenomic approach and deep sequencing to examine respiratory samples from children with lower and upper respiratory tract infections that had been previously found negative for 6 bacteria and 15 respiratory viruses by PCR. Nasal washings from 25 children (out of 250) hospitalized with a diagnosis of pneumonia and nasopharyngeal swabs from 46 outpatient children (out of 526) were studied. DNA reads for at least one virus commonly associated to respiratory infections was found in 20 of 25 hospitalized patients, while reads for pathogenic respiratory bacteria were detected in the remaining 5 children. For outpatients, all the samples were pooled into 25 DNA libraries for sequencing. In this case, in 22 of the 25 sequenced libraries at least one respiratory virus was identified, while in all other, but one, pathogenic bacteria were detected. In both patient groups reads for respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus-OC43, and rhinovirus were identified. In addition, viruses less frequently associated to respiratory infections were also found. Saffold virus was detected in outpatient but not in hospitalized children. Anellovirus, rotavirus, and astrovirus, as well as several animal and plant viruses were detected in both groups. No novel viruses were identified. Adding up the deep sequencing results to the PCR data, 79.2% of 250 hospitalized and 76.6% of 526 ambulatory patients were positive for viruses, and all other children, but one, had pathogenic respiratory bacteria identified. These results suggest that at least in the type of populations studied and with the sampling methods used the odds of finding novel, clinically relevant viruses, in pediatric respiratory infections are low.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>Emergence and re-emergence of respiratory virus infections represent a significant threat to global public health, as they occur seasonally and less frequently (such as in the case of influenza virus) as pandemic infections. Some of these viruses have been in the human population for centuries and others had recently emerged as a public health problem. Influenza viruses have been affecting the human population for a long time now; however, their ability to rapidly evolve through antigenic drift and antigenic shift causes the emergence of new strains. A recent example of these events is the avian-origin H7N9 influenza virus outbreak currently undergoing in China. Human H7N9 influenza viruses are resistant to amantadines and some strains are also resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors greatly limiting the options for treatment. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may cause a lower respiratory tract infection characterized by bronchiolitis and pneumonia mainly in children and the elderly. Infection with RSV can cause severe disease and even death, imposing a severe burden for pediatric and geriatric health systems worldwide. Treatment for RSV is mainly supportive since the only approved therapy, a monoclonal antibody, is recommended for prophylactic use in high-risk patients. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerging respiratory virus. The virus was first recognized in 2012 and it is associated with a lower respiratory tract disease that is more severe in patients with comorbidities. No licensed vaccines or antivirals have been yet approved for the treatment of MERS-CoV in humans. It is clear that the discovery and development of novel antivirals that can be used alone or in combination with existing therapies to treat these important respiratory viral infections are critical. In this review, we will describe some of the novel therapeutics currently under development for the treatment of these infections.</td>

      <td>Background: The management of children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is largely influenced by the development of new molecular diagnostic tests that allow the simultaneous detection of a wide range of pathogens. Objectives: Evaluation of a diagnostic approach including multiplex PCR assays for revisiting the epidemiology and etiology of CAP in children at hospital. Study design: Children of all ages consulting at the Emergency Department of the University hospital of Saint-Etienne, France, during the 2012-2013 winter period were included. In addition to bacterial cultures, the following pathogens were detected using biplex commercially-available rt-PCR tests: adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumonia. Results: From 85 patients with CAP, at least one pathogen was identified in 81 cases (95.3%), including 4 bacterial exclusive infections (4.7%), 53 viral exclusive infections (62.4%) and 24 mixed infections (28.2%). Coinfection by at least two viruses was observed in 37 cases (43.5%). Mean age was higher in the case of documented bacterial infection (P &lt; 0.05). In the subgroup of viral exclusive infection, the mean age of severe cases was 2.0 years vs 3.8 years in mild and moderate cases (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: These findings highlight the huge proportion of CAP of viral origin, the high number of coinfection by multiple viruses and the low number of bacterial CAP, notably in children under 5 years, and address the need to re-evaluate the indications of empiric antimicrobial treatment in this age group.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>Respiratory virus infections, such as those mediated by influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), rhinovirus, and adenovirus, are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in children and older adults. Furthermore, the potential emergence of highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus poses a significant public health threat. Thus, the development of vaccines capable of eliciting long-lasting protective immunity to those pathogens is a major public health priority. CD8 + Tissue-resident memory T (T RM ) cells are a newly defined population that resides permanently in the nonlymphoid tissues including the lung. These cells are capable of providing local protection immediately after infection, thereby promoting rapid host recovery. Recent studies have offered new insights into the anatomical niches that harbor lung CD8 + T RM cells, and also identified the requirement and limitations of T RM maintenance. However, it remains controversial whether lung CD8 + T RM cells are continuously replenished by new cells from the circulation or permanently lodged in this site. A better understanding of how lung CD8 + T RM cells are generated and maintained and the tissue-specific factors that drive local T RM formation is required for optimal vaccine development. This review focuses on recent advance in our understanding of CD8 + T RM cell establishment and maintenance in the lung, and describes how those processes are uniquely regulated in this tissue.</td>

      <td>The human coronavirus NL63 is generally classified as a common cold pathogen, though the infection may also result in severe lower respiratory tract diseases, especially in children, patients with underlying disease, and elderly. It has been previously shown that HCoV-NL63 is also one of the most important causes of croup in children. In the current manuscript we developed a set of polymer-based compounds showing prominent anticoronaviral activity. Polymers have been recently considered as promising alternatives to small molecule inhibitors, due to their intrinsic antimicrobial properties and ability to serve as matrices for antimicrobial compounds. Most of the antimicrobial polymers show antibacterial properties, while those with antiviral activity are much less frequent. A cationically modified chitosan derivative, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), and hydrophobically-modified HTCC were shown to be potent inhibitors of HCoV-NL63 replication. Furthermore, both compounds showed prominent activity against murine hepatitis virus, suggesting broader anticoronaviral activity.</td>
