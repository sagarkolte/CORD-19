      <td>BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>Background: The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia is globally concerning. We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported. Methods: Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared. Findings: Compared with the non-pregnant adults group ( n = 14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed ( n = 16) and clinically-diagnosed ( n = 25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults ( P = 0 路007, P &lt; 0 路001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults ( P = 0 路001, P &lt; 0 路001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twentythree patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6-9 days after initial CT scans. Interpretation: Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation. The exposure history and clinical symptoms were more helpful for screening in children versus chest CT.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>Word Count: 497 27 28 Data on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are sparse. For SARS, the largest series of 12 71 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included ARDS in four, disseminated 72 intravascular coagulopathy in three, renal failure in three, secondary bacterial pneumonia in two, 73 and sepsis in two patients. Mechanical ventilation was three times more likely among pregnant 74 compared to nonpregnant women. Among seven first-trimester infections, four ended in 75 spontaneous abortion. Four of five women with SARS after 24 weeks gestation delivered 76 preterm. For MERS-CoV, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which two were 77 asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; three patients (23%) died. Two 78 pregnancies ended in fetal demise and two were born preterm. No evidence of in utero 79 transmission was seen in SARS or MERS. 80 Currently, no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and 81 Drug Administration. Because COVID-19 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, 82 management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal 83 monitoring. Principles of management of COVID-19 in pregnancy include early isolation, 84 aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, empiric 85 antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), SARS-CoV-2 and co-infection testing, fetal 86 and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory 87 failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multi-specialty 88 consultations. 89 Information on the COVID-19 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow 90 the CDC website to stay up-to-date with the latest information.</td>
