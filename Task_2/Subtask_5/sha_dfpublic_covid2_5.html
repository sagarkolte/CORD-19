      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>The global spread of COVID-19 is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare services. In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information could help to inform future decisions about the restructuring of existing health services by governments, public health bodies and policy makers in response to public health crises such as COVID-19.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has sparked an outflow of scientific research seeking to understand the virus, its spread, and best practices in prevention and treatment. If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contrast between researchers' commitment to doing important research and their reporting practices reveals underlying weaknesses in the research community's reporting habits, but not necessarily their science.</td>

      <td>Recent international epidemics of coronavirus-associated illnesses underscore the urgent medical and public health need for vaccine development and regulatory body approved therapies. In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life. Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials. Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on in vitro and in vivo studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524™), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings. As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded. It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Health community to stay up to date on the most promising potential therapeutic options that are under investigation. Thus, the purpose of this review is to synthesize the knowledge to date about remdesivir as a therapeutic option for coronaviruses, with a special focus on information relevant to the One Health community.

The COVID-19 emerged in December 2009 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health intervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling.</td>

      <td>The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the end of 2019 in China has triggered a global public health crisis. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the same as SARS-CoV. The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes. Our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pancreatic injury in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that pancreatitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection should also be paid attention in clinical work.</td>

      <td>The legal behaviors in using medical masks in public have been finally promulgated by the Vietnamese Government after 47 days since the WHO declared the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From a sample of 345 Vietnamese respondents aged from 15 to 47 years, this brief note found that the risk perception of COVID-19 danger significantly increases the likelihood of wearing the medical masks. In addition, there is a weak evidence about the differences in age under the COVID-19 outbreaks. More noticeably, those who use masks before COVID-19 pandemic tend to maintain their behaviors. Our results offer the insightful into Vietnamese citizens' responses in terms of using medical masks; even the uses of this method are still controversial. Our results are robust by performing Exploratory Factor Analysis for five features and further regressions.</td>

      <td>ABSTRCT 29 Given the scale and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 30 (SARS-CoV-2, known as 2019-nCov) infection , the ongoing global 31 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has become a huge public health issue. Rapid and precise 32 diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19, 33 providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reverse 34 transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled with 35 nanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfully 36 established for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment 37 (such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63°C) 38 for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame 39 1a/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified 40 and detected in a 'one-step' and 'single-tube' reaction, and the detection results were 41 easily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 42 copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated 43 from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients, 44 the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33) in the oropharynx swab 45 samples, and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96) when analyzed the clinical 46 samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients. The total diagnosis test from sample 47 collection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h. In sum, the 48 RT-LAMP-NBS is a promising tool for diagnosing the current SARS-CoV-2 49 infection in first line field, public health and clinical laboratories, especially for 50 resource-challenged regions.</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R 0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R t . In the first assumption, R t was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R t = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R t was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R t = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R t = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce R t to an ideal level and control the infection.</td>

In Italy, the magnitude and increasing trend of the case-fatality risk (CFR) is fueling the already high levels of public alarm. In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age.</td>

      <td>In the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, currently vaccines and specific anti-viral treatment are not yet available. Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.</td>

      <td>Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Unknown unknowns -COVID-19 and potential global mortality Abstract COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a global pandemic. This paper will attempt to estimate global infection rates and potential resultant mortality in the absence of effective treatment and/or vaccination. Calculations are based on World Health Organisation data from Wuhan in China: 14% of infected cases are severe, 5% require intensive care and 4% die. Estimated infection rates and mortality rates at the level of continents and some individual countries (when these are of sufficient size) are tabulated. This pandemic may cause close to half a billion deaths, i.e. 6% of the global populationand potentially more. At the risk of sounding sensational, but with a sober sense of realism, healthcare risks being plunged into the Middle-Ages if the public do not do their part. Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact. The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the standard precautions so frequently reiterated by Public Health: hand washing, avoid touching the face and so on. These measures are crucial as the human cost is going to be unthinkable even in the best-case scenarios that epidemiologists are modelling.</td>

      <td>We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection using the public available data from the China CDC. This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are discussed.</td>

      <td>The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 31 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To 32 develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular 33 mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein 34 used a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that 35 SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of 36 SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core 37 of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that 38 several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with 39 enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus 40 fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by 41 divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We 42 then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent 43 fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and 44 pseudovirus infection with IC 50 s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241-and 149-fold more 45 potent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective 46 against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses 47 tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently 48 inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. 49 Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected 50 mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and 51 treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging 52 SARSr-CoVs. 53 including 2,618 deaths, were reported in China and 27 other countries 11 , posing a 70 serious threat to global public health and thus calling for the prompt development of 71 specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics for treatment and prevention 72 of COVID-19. 73 Coronaviruses (CoVs), the largest RNA viruses identified so far, belonging to the 74 Coronaviridae family, are divided into 4 genera, α-, β-, δ-and γ-coronaviruses, while 75 the β-coronaviruses are further divided into A, B, C, and D lineages. The seven CoVs 76 that can infect humans (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in the 77 α-coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the β-coronaviruses lineage A, 78 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the β-coronaviruses lineage B (β-B coronaviruses), 79 and MERS-CoV in the β-coronaviruses lineage C 6 . To develop specific SARS-CoV-2 80 fusion inhibitors, it is essential to study the fusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared 81 to that of SARS-CoV. Particularly, the spike (S) protein S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2, We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2's 6-HB core and 111 identified several mutated amino acid residues in HR1 domain responsible for its 112 enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. By conjugating the cholesterol molecule to 113 the EK1 peptide, we found that one of the lipopeptides, EK1C4, exhibited highly 114 potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion and PsV 115 infection, about 240-and 150-fold more potent than EK1 peptide, respectively. 116 EK1C4 is also highly effective against in vitro and in vivo infection of some live 117 HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, suggesting potential for 118 further development as pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based therapeutics and prophylactics 119 for treatment and prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 120 and MERS-CoV, as well as future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging 121 SARSr-CoVs. 122 Results 123 The capacity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion 124 From the GISAID Platform (https://platform.gisaid.org), we obtained the 125 full-length amino-acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV 2019-2020) S protein 126 (GenBank: QHD43416). Through alignment with SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs S 127 proteins, we located the functional domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which 128 contains S1 subunit and S2 subunit with the cleavage site at R685/S686 15 . S1 subunit 129 is located within the N-terminal 14-685 amino acids of S protein, containing 130 N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD), and receptor binding 131 motif (RBM). S2 subunit contains fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad 132 repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic domain (CP) (Fig. 1b) .</td>

      <th>Abstract</th>
      <td>The COVID-19 death-rate in Italy continues to climb, surpassing that in every other country. We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government' public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. Except for slightly lower compliance among young adults, all subgroups we studied understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government , or think the government has been untruthful about the crisis believe the messaging and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Communications should move from explaining to citizens that they should stay at home to what they can do there. We need interventions that make staying following public health protocols more desirable, such as virtual social interactions, online social reading activities, classes, exercise routines, etc. -all designed to reduce the boredom of long term social isolation and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations. Interventions like these will grow in importance as the crisis wears on around the world, and staying inside wears on people. 1 Roma Capitale (Municipality of Rome) convened our "COVID-19 International Behavioral Science Working Group" to (i) strengthen its public health policies and guidance, (ii) suggest new policies and guidance based on rigorous behavioral science, and (iii) develop empirical evidence about behavioral change. We report here empirical results and policy interventions aimed at achieving the objectives of the national Italian Government concerning the containment of the pandemic.
