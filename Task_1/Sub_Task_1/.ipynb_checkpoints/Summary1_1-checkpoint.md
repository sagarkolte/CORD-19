### Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.

## Vocabulary Used:
1. incubation
2. age
3. convalescent
4. transmission
5. contagious
6. recovery
7. convalescence

# Note on the vocabulary
The carriers that transmit the disease after recovery are called convalescent transmitters/carriers.
The carriers that transmit the disease during incubation are called incubation carriers/trnasmitters.
Hence we found it necessary to include these words in our vocabulary. We have excluded the word 'health' because we notice that it tends to be used more frequently in the context of health care which is not the subject of this subtask.

## Notes on the Main Cluster Diagram
1. The relationship between age and transmission seems to be particularly well represented in the corpus.
2. Incubation and transmission seem to have been discussed in a reasonable number of articles, it is however not as many as the first category.
3. While 'convalescence' seems like a sparingly used word in the corpus, 'recovery' and 'transmission' appear together in a few documents, this gives us the hope that we might find information about convalescent transmitters in this overlap.
4. We also seem fairly well placed in terms of finding information about 'transmission' during 'incubation'.
5. The dependence of 'age' on 'incubation' periods also might be present here.

## Choice of pairs of words to uncover the subtopics
1. age, transmission : This is to understand the relationship between age and transmissibility.
2. age, incubation: This is to understand the relationship between age and the incubation period.*
3. recovery, transmission: This is to understand the phenomenon of convalescent transmitters.*
4. convalescent, transmission: This is for the same reason as above.*

*these tasks were explicitly mentioned in the formal challenge.

--recovery does not seem like an appropriate word to search for convalescent transmission.

Contrary to our expectations about finding transmissibility during convalescence, we found possible ways to treat patients using the blood of convalescent patients.

This article has an interesting analysis of the incubation period as a random variable and its parameters as a function of age.
An excerpt:
text: "The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable."

While we hoped that this article will shed light on convalescent transmission, it actually does not. However it has some interesting statements to make about delayed recovery and non-uniform transmission on the spread of diseases. 
An Excerpt:
text: "We investigate the effects of delaying the time to recovery (delayed recovery) and of nonuniform transmission on the propagation of diseases on structured populations. Through a mean-field approximation and large-scale numerical simulations, we find that postponing the transition from the infectious to the recovered states can largely reduce the epidemic threshold, therefore promoting the outbreak of epidemics. On the other hand, if we consider nonuniform transmission among individuals, the epidemic threshold increases, thus inhibiting the spreading process. When both mechanisms are at work, the latter might prevail, hence resulting in an increase of the epidemic threshold with respect to the standard case, in which both ingredients are absent. Our findings are of interest for a better understanding of how diseases propagate on structured populations and to a further design of efficient immunization strategies."
