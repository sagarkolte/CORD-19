"The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable."

"The characteristics of MERS differ between South Korea and the Middle East area. The R value of MERS was reported to be below 1 in the Middle East area, except in one study [15] , but was from 2.5-8.1 in South Korea [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Although studies using data from the Middle East area reported 0.42-4% secondary attack rates, studies in South Korea reported 4-6% secondary attack rates for patients or hospital visitors [5] , and 3.7-15.8% for the overall attack rate [23, 24] . The MERS incubation period was reported to be 4.5-5.2 days in the Middle East area [7, 29] , but this period was found to be slightly longer in South Korea [3] [4] [5] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] ."
