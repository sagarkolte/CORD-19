text: "Influenza is commonly thought to be transmitted by three mechanisms (droplet, contact, and aerosol (droplet nuclei)) (CDRF, 2006) . Some diseases (e.g., tuberculosis) are known to be mainly transmitted by the droplet nuclei route, whereas droplet transmission is considered by many to be the dominant route for some other diseases (e.g., mumps), although the actual routes are still being debated (Fiegel, Clarke, & Edwards, 2006; Tellier, 2006; Yang et al., 2007) . Salgado, Farr, Hall, and Hayden (2002) suggested different roles in influenza between droplet and aerosol transmission. Influenza is mainly spread through droplet transmission by coughing and sneezing from infectious people, while aerosol transmission is important for long-distance and sporadic infection. An infected human can be a source of large droplets generated by coughing and sneezing. During airborne transmission, these droplets will shrink in size with the consequence that both droplets and droplet nuclei contact surfaces. Although many researchers have examined the droplet size generated from humans, the actual size is not clear. Yang et al. (2007) reported that most droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking have diameter between 1 and 20 mm, and these droplets may contract depending on the humidity and medium generated. Viruses in these droplets can aggregate with each other or be encased by the saliva component, both enhancing persistence of viability. Meanwhile, viability of viruses in saliva can be attenuated by an enzyme action (Diaz-Arnold & Marek, 2002) . Therefore, it is important that the transmission medium be factored into the design of the test method."

text: "The global seafood industry produces large amounts of waste with huge potential for utilization [1] . As an example, the Norwegian and Icelandic seafood industries produced 1.246.000 tons of by-products in 2013 combined [2] . A portion of this material is used for low value products whereas a large share becomes waste with concurring strain on the environment [2] . Of the underutilized by-products from the seafood industry, fish viscera is a rich source of proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase [3] . A variety of industrial applications for fish trypsins have recently been reviewed [4] . Trypsin from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) gets special attention in the review [4] due to the thorough basic knowledge available on different cod trypsin isoenzymes and their potential use in high-value products for therapeutic applications for humans [5] . Notably, recent studies have shown that cod trypsin has efficacy against human respiratory viruses and herpes simplex virus in vitro [5] . The epidermal mucus of fish contains trypsin like serine proteases that play a significant role in the natural defence of fish against pathogens such as viruses and bacteria [6] [7] [8] [9] . Atlantic cod trypsin is produced from viscera as production of recombinant trypsin is not yet economically feasible [10] [11] [12] . Two main trypsin groups have been identified in Atlantic cod, termed group I and group III, based on their deduced amino acid sequence identities [13] [14] [15] [16] . Different Atlantic cod group I trypsin isoenzymes have been isolated, purified and characterized [14, 17] . Cod trypsin ZT belongs to group III trypsins. To our knowledge, cDNA sequences for group III trypsins have thus far only been described in fish [18] . Prior to this report, the group III trypsins have not been thoroughly characterized. Therefore, it was difficult to contemplate the physiological role or potential utilization of cod trypsin ZT, due to lack of biochemical data on the group III trypsins. In that context, cleavage specificity, sensitivity to inhibitors and stability is of interest. Stability analysis of proteins that have possible therapeutic applications or industrial use is important [4, [19] [20] [21] ."

text: "The 59-cap structure is a distinct feature of eukaryotic mRNAs, and eukaryotic viruses generally modify the 59-end of viral RNAs to mimic cellular mRNA structure, which is important for RNA stability, protein translation and viral immune escape. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes two S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTase) which sequentially methylate the RNA cap at guanosine-N7 and ribose 29-O positions, catalyzed by nsp14 N7-MTase and nsp16 29-O-MTase, respectively. A unique feature for SARS-CoV is that nsp16 requires non-structural protein nsp10 as a stimulatory factor to execute its MTase activity. Here we report the biochemical characterization of SARS-CoV 29-O-MTase and the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex bound with methyl donor SAM. We found that SARS-CoV nsp16 MTase methylated m7GpppA-RNA but not m7GpppG-RNA, which is in contrast with nsp14 MTase that functions in a sequence-independent manner. We demonstrated that nsp10 is required for nsp16 to bind both m7GpppA-RNA substrate and SAM cofactor. Structural analysis revealed that nsp16 possesses the canonical scaffold of MTase and associates with nsp10 at 1:1 ratio. The structure of the nsp16/nsp10 interaction interface shows that nsp10 may stabilize the SAM-binding pocket and extend the substrate RNA-binding groove of nsp16, consistent with the findings in biochemical assays. These results suggest that nsp16/nsp10 interface may represent a better drug target than the viral MTase active site for developing highly specific anticoronavirus drugs.

            "text": "Previously we revealed that the extra domain of SARS 3CLpro mediated the catalysis via different mechanisms. While the R298A mutation completely abolished the dimerization, thus resulting in the inactive catalytic machinery, N214A inactivated the enzyme by altering its dynamics without significantly perturbing its structure. Here we studied another mutant with S284-T285-I286 replaced by Ala (STI/A) with a 3.6-fold activity increase and slightly enhanced dimerization. We determined its crystal structure, which still adopts the dimeric structure almost identical to that of the wild-type (WT), except for slightly tighter packing between two extra-domains. We then conducted 100-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for both STI/ A and WT, the longest reported so far for 3CLpro. In the simulations, two STI/A extra domains become further tightly packed, leading to a significant volume reduction of the nano-channel formed by residues from both catalytic and extra domains. The enhanced packing appears to slightly increase the dynamic stability of the N-finger and the first helix residues, which subsequently triggers the redistribution of dynamics over residues directly contacting them. This ultimately enhances the dynamical stability of the residues constituting the catalytic dyad and substrate-binding pockets. Further correlation analysis reveals that a global network of the correlated motions exists in the protease, whose components include all residues identified so far to be critical for the dimerization and catalysis. Most strikingly, the N214A mutation globally decouples this network while the STI/A mutation alters the correlation pattern. Together with previous results, the present study establishes that besides the classic structural allostery, the dynamic allostery also operates in the SARS 3CLpro, which is surprisingly able to relay the perturbations on the extra domain onto the catalytic machinery to manifest opposite catalytic effects. Our results thus imply a promising avenue to design specific inhibitors for 3CL proteases by disrupting their dynamic correlation network.
