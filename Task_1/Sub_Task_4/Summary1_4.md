### Physical science of the coronavirus (e.g., charge distribution, adhesion to hydrophilic/phobic surfaces, environmental survival to inform decontamination efforts for affected areas and provide information about viral shedding).

## Vocabulary Used
1. charge
2. coronavirus
3. hydrophilic
4. hydrophobic
5. surface
6. persistence


# Notes on the vocabulary
The use of the word persistence requires an explanation, we use this word in place of 'survival' as experience suggests that survival is being used in the context of the survival of victims.

## Notes on the main cluster diagram
Clearly, we seem to have found a few articles where charge and distribution occur simultaneously. There seem to be a number of documents about hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces.  There seems to be a significant corpus of articles on the coronavirus and the term hydrophobic. There are articles on charge that are also about coronavirus.

## Choice of pairs of words to uncover the subtopics
1. charge, distribution

This article discussed the role of charge distribution in the process by which clays reduce the infectivity of viruses.

    Excerpt:
"text": "Prior studies of clay-virus interactions have focused on the stability and infectivity of nonenveloped viruses, yielding contradictory results. We hypothesize that the surface charge distribution of the clay and virus envelope dictates how the components react and affect aggregation, viral stability, and infectivity. The bacteriophage Cystoviridae species \u03c66 used in this study is a good model for enveloped pathogens. The interaction between \u03c66 and montmorillonite (MMT) clay (the primary component of bentonite) is explored by transmission electron microscopy. The analyses show that MMT-\u03c66 mixtures undergo heteroaggregation, forming structures in which virtually all the virions are either sequestered between MMT platelet layers or attached to platelet edges. The virions swell and undergo disassembly resulting in partial or total envelope loss. Edgeattached viral envelopes distort to increase contact area with the positively charged platelet edges indicating that the virion surface is negatively charged. The nucleocapsid (NCs) remaining after envelope removal also exhibit distortion, in contrast to detergent-produced NCs which exhibit no distortion. This visually discernible disassembly is a mechanism for loss of infectivity previously unreported by studies of nonenveloped viruses. The MMT-mediated sequestration and disassembly result in reduced infectivity, suggesting that clays may reduce infectivity of enveloped pathogenic viruses in soils and sediments.",

This article discusses the role of hybrid nano-structures of multiwalled carbon nano-tubes in increasing the efficiency to air filters against microorganisms.

    Excerpt:
"text": "Controlling airborne microorganisms has become increasingly important with increase in human indoor activities, epidemic disease outbreaks, and airborne pathogen transmission. Treatments using antimicrobial nanoparticles have shown promise because of the high surface-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles compared to their bulk counterparts, and their unique physical and chemical properties. In this study, hybrid nanostructures of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) coated with antimicrobial, natural product (NP) nanoparticles were synthesized using a twin-head electrospray system (THES). The coated nanoparticles were then used in antimicrobial air filters to increase their antimicrobial efficiency.

This article studies the fabrication of metal surfaces which are hostile towards viruses and bacteria.

    Excerpt:

"text": "The LSTO Ti-V-O coating also demonstrated excellent antibacterial properties ( Figure 11 ). Similar to HTA Ti-V-O coatings, the titanium oxide produced through LSTO had photoactive antibacterial effects [17, 18] , and the vanadium oxide produced also exhibited antibacterial properties [19] . By combining titanium oxide and vanadium oxide, the presented results coincided with the study of Wren et al., indicating that the Ti-V-O thin film exhibited greater antibacterial properties [20] . By contrast, the 100 kHz of LSTO Ti-V-O coating demonstrated higher antibacterial properties because of its superhydrophobic surface (i.e., exhibiting a water contact angle of 140 \u2022 ). In reference to Zhang et al. [11] , when the coating surface came into contact with bacteria cells, the superhydrophobic surface lowered the binding power between the bacteria cell and sample surface. This reduced bacterial cells' ability to attach to the sample surface, resulting in antibacterial effects. As a result of this, the 100 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coating seems to exhibit superior antibacterial properties compared with the 300 kHz and 500 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coatings. The present study verified that the Ti-V-O coating exhibited excellent antibacterial properties, and the vanadium compounds within the Ti-V-O coating induced inflammation in cells. Some researchers have indicated that oxidation states of vanadium could induce DNA damage [21, 22] in cells, and excessive amounts of vanadium compounds exert observable toxic effects on body tissues [23] . Although vanadium has been confirmed as a toxic transition metal, the application of it, in cancer treatment and as a novel medicine in special compounds against viral infections, such as Dengue fever, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) [24] , still shows great potential for the future.

This article makes some observations on the presence of hydrobhobic proteins present in the coronavirus genome and its properties.

    Excerpt:

"text": "The open reading frame potentially encoding a 78 amino acid, 9101 Da hydrophobic protein (HP) and, mapping at the 3' end of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome, was shown to be expressed during virus replication. The cloned HP gene was placed in a plasmid under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and in vitro translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded a 9.1 -kDa protein that was immunoprecipitable with porcine hyperimmune anti-TGEV serum. Antiserum raised in rabbits against a 31 amino acid synthetic polypeptide that represented the central hydrophilic region of HP specifically immunoprecipitated HP from TGEV-infected cells. HP was further shown to become associated with microsomal membranes during synthesis in vitro and was found to be closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and cell surface membranes in infected cells. The intracellular location of HP suggests that it may play a role in the membrane association of replication complexes or in virion assembly. o 1992",

    Excerpt:

This study thus identifies residues critical for RNA binding on the nucleocapsid surface, and presents biochemical and genetic evidence that directly links the RNA binding capacity of the coronavirus N protein to the viral infectivity in cultured cells. This information would be useful in development of preventive and treatment approaches against coronavirus infection."

"title": "Hexamethylene amiloride blocks E protein ion channels and inhibits coronavirus replication"

    Excerpt:
We have demonstrated that the Vpu ion channel activity in planar lipid bilayers is blocked by the amiloride derivate HMA, and that HMA also inhibits replication of HIV-1 in cultured human macrophages . For some other viral ion channels, inhibitors have also been discovered (Griffin et al., 2003; Pavlovic et al., 2003; Premkumar et al., 2005; Premkumar et al., 2004) , although evidence of antiviral activity of the compounds has not yet been published. The goals of our research were, therefore, to identify other coronavirus E protein ion channels, find blockers of the channel activity and characterize the effect of channel-blocking compounds on viral replication."

This article has possible indications of generic drugs that target coronavirus related infections
    Excerpt:


"text": "The tertiary structures of the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein of the coronavirus which is responsible of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been recently predicted. Here a molecular assembly of SARS coronavirus peplomer which accounts for the available functional data is suggested. The interaction between S1 and S2 appears to be stabilised by a large hydrophobic network of aromatic side chains present in both domains. This feature results to be common to all coronaviruses, suggesting potential targeting for drugs preventing coronavirus-related infections.",
